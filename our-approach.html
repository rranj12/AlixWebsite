                Nearly a century ago, the world had no recourse for the 1918 influenza (Spanish Flu) pandemic, a pandemic comparable to Covid-19 that infected over 500 million people and killed over 10 million people. Fast forward to 2021, the world's top scientists & pharmaceutical companies have become household names that have advanced and deployed Covid-19 vaccines to over 4.4 billion people around the world. So where did our modern biotechnology toolbox come from? And where could it be going?

                    The 'birth' of the biotechnology industry is frequently recognized as the founding of 
                    <a href="https://www.gene.com/about-us/leadership/our-founders" class="link-blue">Genentech</a> 
                    in 1976 by Herb Boyer & Robert Swanson. Genentech's core innovation centered around manufacturing; specifically, the ability to produce and manufacture human growth hormone (hGH) using microbes & recombinant DNA. By genetically engineering microbes to produce biological molecules of interest, biology suddenly unlocked an efficient means of production for biomolecules, usurping the traditional and crude methods of harvesting biomolecules like epinephrine & insulin from animals.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                    By 1979, Genentech was able to produce the first human version of insulin using their microbial-based genetic engineering technique. Genentech (named from Genetic Engineering Technology) was not the only company founded on the breakthroughs of molecular genetic engineering. 
                    <a href="https://www.biogen.com/en_us/history-overview.html" class="link-default">Biogen</a> 
                    (formerly Biotechnology Geneva) and 
                    <a href="https://www.amgen.com/about/amgen-history" class="link-blue">Amgen</a> 
                    (formerly Applied Molecular Genetics), were founded in 1978 & 1980 respectively to harness and engineer recombinant microbes to manufacture treatments and cures for diseases.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                    Thus, the key tenant of the biotechnology industry has been engineering and application. While basic science research has existed for centuries, modern developments in the biotech industry have been about applying science to manufacturing, scale, efficiency, and distribution. In other words, modern biotechnology harnesses biological insights and addresses problems in human health through engineering.
